# CanadarmTaskRecording

Code for recording and processing data from the Canadarm task in the Unity simulator created at Imperial College London by Daniel Freer.

To run the simulator, download VR_ISS_build.exe, VR_ISS_build_Data.zip, and UnityPlayer.dll. Extract the zip file in the same folder as the other two downloaded files, and run the executable! The simulator will run best with a 4:3 resolution (i.e. 1280x960).

To receive LSL data from the simulator, follow the example in the python code above. More explanation will soon be written for clarity.

The C# files in UnityScripts are the custom source code for the executable, if you wish to create something similar.
