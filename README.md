# CanadarmTaskRecording

Code for recording and processing data from the Canadarm task in the Unity simulator created at Imperial College London by Daniel Freer.

To run the simulator, download VR_ISS_build.exe, VR_ISS_build_Data.zip, and UnityPlayer.dll. Extract the zip file in the same folder as the other two downloaded files, and run the executable!

To receive LSL data from the simulator, follow the example in the python code above. More explanation will soon be written for clarity.
